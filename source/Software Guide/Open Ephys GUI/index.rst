Open Ephys GUI Plugin
--------------------------------------------

The `Open Ephys GUI <https://open-ephys.github.io/gui-docs/index.html>`__ is an
open-source, plugin-based application for acquiring extracellular
electrophysiology data. It was designed by neuroscientists to make their
experiments more flexible and enjoyable. It works equally well on macOS, Linux,
and Windows.

..  note:: An ONIX plugin for the Open Ephys is in development. To access all of
	ONIX's capabilities right now, have a look at the 
	`OpenEphys.Onix1 <https://open-ephys.github.io/bonsai-onix1-docs/index.html>`__ 
	Bonsai Package.
	**In the meantime, you can still take advantage of the GUI's excellent
	ephys visualizaiton tools by streaming data from Bonsai to the GUI using
	the** `Ephys Socket Plugin <https://open-ephys.github.io/gui-docs/User-Manual/Plugins/Ephys-Socket.html>`__.
