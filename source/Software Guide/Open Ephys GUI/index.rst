Open Ephys GUI
--------------------------------------------

The `Open Ephys GUI <https://open-ephys.github.io/gui-docs/index.html>`__ is an
open-source, plugin-based application for acquiring extracellular
electrophysiology data. It was designed by neuroscientists to make their
experiments more flexible and enjoyable. It works equally well on macOS, Linux,
and Windows.

.. note:: An ONIX plugin for the Open Ephys is in development. To access all of
   ONIX's capabilities right now, have a look at the :ref:`Bonsai library
   <openephys_onix1ref>`. **You can still take advantage of the GUI's excellent
   ephys visualizaiton tools by streaming data from Bonsai to the GUI using
   the** `Ephys Socket Plugin <https://open-ephys.github.io/gui-docs/User-Manual/Plugins/Ephys-Socket.html>`__.
