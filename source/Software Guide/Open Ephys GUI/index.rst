Open Ephys GUI Plugin
--------------------------------------------

The `Open Ephys GUI <https://open-ephys.github.io/gui-docs/index.html>`__ is an
open-source, plugin-based application for acquiring extracellular
electrophysiology data. It was designed by neuroscientists to make their
experiments more flexible and enjoyable. It works equally well on macOS, Linux,
and Windows.

An ONIX Source plugin for the Open Ephys GUI is in development.

To access all of ONIX's capabilities right now, have a look at the `OpenEphys.Onix1 Bonsai Package Docs <https://open-ephys.github.io/bonsai-onix1-docs/index.html>`__. Even when acquiring in Bonsai, you can still take advantage of the GUI's excellent ephys visualization tools by streaming data from Bonsai to the GUI using the Ephys Socket Plugin as explained in `this tutorial <https://open-ephys.github.io/bonsai-onix1-docs/articles/tutorials/ephys-socket.html>`__.
