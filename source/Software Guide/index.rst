:ref:`Bonsai ONIX Package <openephys_onix1ref>`
    :ref:`OpenEphys.Onix1 <openephys_onix1ref>` is a `Bonsai
    <https://bonsai-rx.org/>`__ package for acquiring data from ONIX hardware
    for real-time experiments. Bonsai is very good at processing the
    heterogeneous data streams produced by ONIX hardware.

:ref:`Open Ephys GUI ONIX Plugin <open_ephys_gui>`
    The `Open Ephys GUI <https://open-ephys.github.io/gui-docs/>` excels at
    electrophysiology data visualization and recording.

:ref:`Command line application <oni_repl>`
    `oni-repl` is a simple command-line application that can be used for
    debugging and basic streaming IO with ONIX hardware.

.. tip:: ONIX uses an `ONI-compliant API
   <https://open-ephys.github.io/ONI/v1.0/api/index.html>`__ that is software
   agnostic. If you want to use ONIX hardware with your acquisition software,
   please :ref:`get in touch <support>`.
