    Bonsai/index
    Open Ephys GUI/index

ONIX uses `Bonsai <https://bonsai-rx.org/>`__ for data acquisition. Bonsai is
very good at dealing with the asynchronous and heterogeneous data that ONIX
hardware produces.

    - The :ref:`bonsai_onixref` page provides detailed information about the
      ONIX Bonsai library. 
    - The :ref:`open_ephys_gui` page provides information on using the `Open
      Ephys GUI <https://open-ephys.org/gui>`__ with ONIX hardware.

.. note:: If you want to use ONIX hardware with your acquisition software,
    please :ref:`get in touch <support>`. It's not as hard as you might think
    :).
