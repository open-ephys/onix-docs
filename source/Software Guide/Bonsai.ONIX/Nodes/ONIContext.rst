.. _bonsai_onicontext:

ONIContext
===============================

.. warning:: This node configures hardware parameters when it is placed in a workflow, even if the workflow is not running. Always check voltage configurations before connecting headstages to the system.

A `Bonsai source <https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/editor/#toolbox>`__ that manages the underlying
**Acquisition Context** and allows basic acquisition parameterization.
There must be at least one of these in every workflow that uses ONIX hardware.

:Inputs:  None
:Outputs: A single ``ONIContextTask`` followed by `Never
          <https://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/empty-never-throw.html>`__.

Purpose
-------------------------------
``Bonsai.ONIX``'s design mirrors the that of the `Open Neuro Interface
specification <https://github.com/open-ephys/ONI>`__. Control of and
acquisition from ONIX hardware is handled by a combination of two or more
nodes: an :ref:`bonsai_onicontext` and potentially many **Device** nodes which
it manages (e.g. :ref:`bonsai_heartbeatdev`, :ref:`bonsai_analogiodev`, etc.). Some
facts about the :ref:`bonsai_onicontext` node are useful for understanding how
to use it.

    :ref:`bonsai_onicontext` is responsible for communicating with hardware and
    the informing devices, identified using their DeviceAddress, that they have
    new data.

- An :ref:`bonsai_onicontext` manages a global **Device Table**. When it is
  placed in a workflow, all device nodes will automatically have access to to
  this table without requiring an explicit connection in the workflow.

- When acquisition is started, the :ref:`bonsai_onicontext` node will produce a
  single ``ONIContextTask`` and then nothing. This "task" runs in the background
  until the workflow is stopped.

- When the workflow is running, the ``ONIContextTask`` uses a dedicated thread
  to read from the host hardware. It then passes data into a blocking queue
  which is read by a second thread that is responsible for informing individual
  device nodes that they have new samples.

- Device nodes are essentially filters for the data stream produced by
  :ref:`bonsai_onicontext`. Device nodes will accept samples that match their
  **DeviceAddress**. This is why each Device node has an DeviceAddress
  parameter that unambiguously identifies them them in a Device Table.

.. important:: Every Bonsai workflow must include at least a single
    :ref:`bonsai_onicontext` which manages a single device table. If multiple
    pieces of host acquisition hardware (e.g. multiple :ref:`pcie_host`) are
    present in a single computer, then each will need its own
    :ref:`bonsai_onicontext` to manage it.

.. _bonsai_onicontext_configuration:

Configuration GUI
--------------------------
:ref:`bonsai_onicontext` configuration is performed using a GUI provided in the
Bonsai.ONIX.Design library. It can be opened by double clicking on the
:ref:`bonsai_onicontext` node if Bonsai.ONIX.Design has been installed.

.. image:: /_static/bonsai/onicontext/ONIContext_configuration.png
   :align: center

This GUI gives access to ONI Context configuration such as as well as the
complete **Device Table**. Devices within the table are available for configuration
using the **Properties Pane** on the right side of the form.

#. **Settings**: Drop down menu that provides several hardware configuration options
#. **Driver**: The device driver used to control the host hardware.
#. **Slot**: The physical slot of the Host hardware in the computer.
#. **Block Read Size**: The number of bytes read per call to the kernel driver.
   Larger numbers *will generally* increase overall bandwidth and decrease
   response latency.
#. **Block Write Size**: The number of bytes pre-allocated to make output for output
   data frames. Larger numbers *may* increase overall bandwidth and decrease
   response latency.
#. |refresh_icon| **<status>**: Shows the current host hardware connection status.
   Clicking will attempt to reconnect to the host hardware.

.. tip:: Optimal values of **Read Block Size** and **Write Block Size** depend heavily
    on the computer being used and the devices being acquired from: e.g.  how many
    devices, at what sample rate, at what frame size, etc.  Experimentation will be
    required to get the lowest response latency. The :ref:`bonsai_latencytest`
    workflow provides a way for users to do this quickly for their hardware setup.

.. warning:: Changes to device registers using the :ref:`bonsai_onicontext` GUI will
    not be saved in the workflow file. To save device register values to file,
    device configuration must be performed using dedicated device nodes.

.. _bonsai_onicontext_hubsettings:

Settings ➞  Hubs...
___________________________
ONIX-specific hub options such as access to raw deserializer data streams:

.. image:: /_static/bonsai/onicontext/ONIContext_hub-configuration.png
     :align: center

:Standard: The hub port is configured to work with official ONIX headstages.
:Passthrough: The hub port is configured to work with compatible
    3rd-party devices, such as UCLA Miniscopes.

.. tip:: Known issue: When the Passthrough radio button is selected for Hub B, no selector appears on either option making it seem nothing is selected, but the hub is actually in Passthrough mode.

.. _bonsai_onicontext_syncsettings:

Settings ➞  Host Sync...
___________________________
Hardware synchronization configuration for two or more hosts that are connected
with a synchronization cable.

.. image:: /_static/bonsai/onicontext/ONIContext_host-sync.png
     :align: center

:Standalone: Acquisition for this host is independent from others host hardware. It
    will run on its own clock and start using an internal trigger.
:Source: The host runs in Standalone mode and shares its acquisition start
    trigger to the selected *Sync Channel*. There is only one Source allowed
    per synchronization channel.
:Listener: The host is synchronized to the *Source* hardware on the
    selected *Sync Channel*. Any number of listeners can be assigned to a
    single *Sync Channel*.

.. important:: Only the acquisition start trigger is shared from Sources to
    Listeners. The acquisition clock may or may not be shared depending on the
    type of host hardware being used. For example, if all hardware consists of
    :ref:`PCIe Hosts <pcie_host>` on the same motherboard, then both start
    trigger and acquisition clocks will be shared and synchronization ed.
    Multiple USB hosts will only share a start trigger and the acquisition
    clocks will drift over time.
