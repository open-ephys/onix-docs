MiniscopeV4Device
===============================
.. important:: To use Miniscopes with ONIX hardware, you must first use the :ref:`bonsai_onicontext` configuration GUI to set the headstage port to :ref:`"Passthrough Mode" <bonsai_onicontext_hubsettings>`

A `Bonsai source <https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/editor/#toolbox>`__  that wraps a
:ref:`onidatasheet_ds90ub9x_raw` device and configures it to allow control over
`UCLA Miniscope V4
<http://miniscope.org/index.php/Overview_of_System_Components>`__.

:Inputs:    None
:Outputs:   A single ``MiniscopeV4DataFrame`` that is produced periodically
            by the scope and contains an image and corresponding sample and
            frame counters.

Configuration
--------------------------
Configuration is performed using the property pane which contains the following
options.

.. list-table::
    :widths: auto
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Name
      - Type
      - Description

    * - EnableStream
      - boolean
      - Enable the device data stream

    * - LEDBrightness
      - double
      - Excitation LED brightness (0-100%).

    * - InterleaveLED
      - bool
      - If true, the excitation LED will only turn on during camera exposures.
        This can reduce photobleaching and tissue heating.

    * - Gain
      - SensorGain (enum)
      - Camera sensor analog gain

    * - FrameRate
      - FPS (enum)
      - Camera images acquired per second.

    * - LiquidLensVoltage
      - double
      - The RMS voltage output by the electrowetting lens driver which
        determines the lens focal length
