Bonsai Learning Resources
--------------------------------
.. note:: Unfortunately, Bonsai's documentation does not do it justice. It is an
    extremely powerful tool for acquiring data and processing all sorts of data
    streams, but documentation is quite scarce. This situation is changing. In
    the meantime, have a look at the following resources.

Accessing Bonsai.ONIX Documentation
----------------------------------------
#. If an ONIX node does not have a configuration GUI (e.g. like
   :ref:`bonsai_heartbeatdev`), then **double clicking** the node will bring
   open its documentation page in your default browser.

#. If an ONIX node has a configuration GUI (e.g.
   :ref:`bonsai_neuropixelsv1dev`), then there will be a **Documentation** link
