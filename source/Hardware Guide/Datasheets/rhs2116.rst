Description
*******************************************
The **RHS2116** device acquires data and controls stimulation for an Intan
`RHS2116 bioamplifier and stimulator chip
<https://intantech.com/files/Intan_RHS2116_datasheet.pdf>`__.

- Fixed sampling rate: 30193.236714975847 kHz/channel
- Real-time control of stimulation sequences
- Real-time control of many acqusition registers (e.g. filter settings,
  artifact recovery parameters, etc.)

      - Determines when artifact recovery sequence is applied to this chip.

        * 0x00: This device only cares about recovering from stimuli that it
          itself creates.
        * 0x01: This device will apply the LPB version of the low pass filter
          if stim_active_i goes high, regardless of whether this device created
          the stimulus.


Unmanaged Registers
------------------------------------------
Direct, unmanaged read and write access is provided to the registers detailed
in the `RHS2116 series datasheet
<https://intantech.com/files/Intan_RHS2116_series_datasheet.pdf>`__.

- Registers are 32-bits wide
- Addresses and functions are determined by the RHS2116 datasheet
- Registers have various designations indicating when the are applied. The
  table below uses the following labels to define when a register change takes
  effect.

  RESET 
    Register value is applied after a full reset
  
  RT (Real-time)
    Register value can be changed during operation. There is worst-case
    delay of 2 SPI cycles for the application to occur.
  
  SEQ (Sequence) 
    Register programming is handled by the internal stimulus sequencer,
    which itself is configured using managed registers.  These should not be
    manipulated externally.

******************************************
Each frame transmitted to the host consists of a 16 low-noise AC ephys samples
and 16 high-voltage DC samples for monitoring compliance and stimulation
waveforms.
