Description
*******************************************
The **RHS2116** device acquires data and controls stimulation from an Intan
`RHS2116 bioamplifier and stimulator chip
<https://intantech.com/files/Intan_RHS2116_datasheet.pdf>`__.

- Fixed sampling rate: 30193.236714975847 kHz/channel
- Real-time control of stimulation sequences
- Real-time control of many acquisition registers (e.g. filter settings,
  artifact recovery parameters, etc.)

          if stim_active_i goes high, regardless of whether this device created
          the stimulus.


Unmanaged Registers
------------------------------------------
Read and write access is provided to the registers detailed in the `RHS2116
series datasheet
<https://intantech.com/files/Intan_RHS2116_datasheet.pdf>`__.

- Registers are 32-bits wide
- Addresses and functions are determined by the RHS2116 datasheet
- Reading and writing is not direct. Register values are stored in RAM and
  applied when the SPI controller encounters them.
- Registers have various designations indicating when they are applied. The
  table below uses the following labels to define when a register change takes
  effect.

  RESET
    Register value is applied after a reset.

  RT (Real-time)
    Register value can be changed during operation. There is worst-case delay
    of ~400 usec for the application to occur. This occurs if there are
    concurrent SEQ register applications, which take precedence. Typically, the
    delay is ~170 usec.

  SEQ (Sequence)
    Register programming is handled by the internal stimulus sequencer,
    which itself is configured using managed registers.  These should not be
    manipulated externally.
