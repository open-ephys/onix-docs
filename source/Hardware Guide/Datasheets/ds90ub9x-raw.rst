Description
*******************************************
The **DS90UB9X Raw Device** can be used to receive raw data from and control
`DS90UB9x <https://www.ti.com/product/DS90UB934-Q1>`__ SERDES pairs. This
device is useful for acquiring data from instruments that use `DS90UB9x3
<https://www.ti.com/product/DS90UB933-Q1>`__ serializers, which are physically
compatible with ONIX host hardware, but do not implement :ref:`ONIX Serization
protocol <serialization>`. For example, third party devices such as `UCLA
Miniscope <http://miniscope.org/index.php/Main_Page>`__ and its derivatives.

Unmanaged Registers
------------------------------------------
Unmanaged read and write access is provided to the SERDES I2C bus when using
register addresses less than 0x8000.

Device To Host Data Frames
******************************************
Each frame transmitted to the host consists of a READSZ-sample frame.

.. wavedrom::

    {
        reg: [
          {bits: 64, name: "Acquisition Clock Counter", type: 0},
          {bits: 32, name: "Device Address", type: 0},

Host To Device Data Frames
******************************************
This device does not accept input frames. All write attempts will fail with an
error.
