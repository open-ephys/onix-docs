Features
-------------------------
The Breakout Board provides access to the following IO:

- 4x headstage port feed-throughs, each with a power switch
- 3x, passive, high-speed clock feed-throughs
- 12x passive, ESD-protected, analog feed-throughs.
- BNC, ribbon, or direct wire access to 12 analog inputs or outputs
- Ribbon cable or direct, wire-access to 8 digital outputs and 8 digital
  inputs. These are 5V compliant.
- `HARP bus <https://www.cf-hw.org/harp>`__ controller

Additionally, it has the following features:

- Lots of indication LEDs
- 6 buttons for marking experimental events for or triggering software actions.
- Rugged M6 and 1/4-20 mounting holes for both metric and imperial optical
  tables
- 19" rack compatibility
- Fully open-source gateware and made using an open-source FPGA toolchain
