Coaxial Commutators
===================================
Active, near-zero torque commutators prevent tether twisting during freely
moving recordings with headstages and/or miniscopes. This page provides a very
brief overview of the commutators; for a more extensive walkthrough, please
follow the `commutator docs
<https://open-ephys.github.io/commutator-docs/index.html>`__.

  ONIX Single Channel Commutator

ONIX uses an active commutator to prevents tether twisting during freely moving
recordings. An inertial measurement unit (IMU) on the headstage or miniscope
sends orientation data to the host computer. Because the real-time orientation
of the animal is known, software can be used to send commands to the commutator
via its USB interface, and the motor in the commutator will turn when the
animal does. A high-quality radio-frequency rotary joint inside the commutator
maintains electrical connectivity for both power and high-frequency data
signals between the tether leading to the headstage and the coaxial cable
leading to the PCIe host board while turning.

In addition to untwisting the tether, the commutator can also play a role in
managing the tether so it doesn't get in the animal's way and counterweight-ing
the headstage. This is performed by hooking a thin elastic string to the hook on
the bottom of the commutator gear. For more information on how to do this, visit
