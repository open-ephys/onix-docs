.. important:: ONIX expands the concept of a headstage compared to what you
    might be used to. ONIX headstages are head-borne systems of sensors and
    actuators that incorporate features like 3D tracking, stimulation
    sequencers, etc. rather than just electrode amplification or calcium
    imaging.

.. note:: We hope that there will be community additions to this list.
    Implementing your own headstage that incorporates other sensors (e.g
    cameras, temperature, etc), or even custom ASICs (e.g. next gen ephys
    probes) and have automatic integration with existing ONIX headstages and
    hardware can be quite simple.  If you're interested in creating a custom
    headstage that works with existing ONIX hardware and software, please get
    in touch using the links on the :ref:`support` page.
