.. _tethers:

Making Coaxial Tethers
==========================
ONIX headstages communicate with host hardware using a `50-Ohm
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_impedance#50_%CE%A9_and_75_%CE%A9>`__
`coaxial cable <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaxial_cable>`__. Because these
tethers only have two conductors, replacing them or making tethers of custom
lengths is quite simple. This page describes methods for creating light and
flexible coaxial headstage tethers.

Which Coaxial Cable?
--------------------------
Any suitable 50-Ohm coaxial cable can be used to make a tether. These
instructions use Axon Cable PCX40K10AK. The cable should be light, flexible
(silicone or thin FEP insulation), thin (less than 1 mm in diameter), and made
by a reputable supplier that can supply information on the cable's electrical
characteristics. Most important are its `DC Resistance
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_and_conductivity>`__ and
RF Loss in the 1 GHz regime.

.. note:: Although the actual quantities matter, and **smaller values are
    better**, the major hurdle is simply finding a supplier that will clearly
    characterize them as this an indication of quality. We have used cables
    from Axon Cable and `cooner wire <https://www.coonerwire.com/micro-coax/>`__
    with good results.

:DC Resistance: For DC signals, resistance is proportional to the inner
    conductor's resistivity and length and inversely proportional to its
    cross-sectional area. The larger the DC resistance of the cable, the larger
    the voltage drop across the cable, which requires increased compensation at
    the voltage source.  DC resistance is a strict function of the cable's size
    and thinner, longer cables will have a higher resistance than thicker,
    shorter cables.

:RF Loss: For radio-frequency signals transmitted in coaxial cables, frequency-dependent resistance
    ("loss") is determined by the `skin effect
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_effect>`__ rather than conductor cross
    sectional area. Higher loss at a particular frequency will limit the length
    of cable over which signals using that frequency band can be reliably sent
    and received. Minimizing RF loss while maintaing uniform characteristic
    impedance characteristics is and engineering challenge and requires
    precision manufacturing.

Required Tools and Materials
    - Solder jig: A copper-clad board with X.FL connectors (`X.FL-R-SMT-1(80) <https://www.hirose.com/en/product/p/CL0331-0701-8-80>`__) soldered to it
      to that hold X.FL sockets in place during soldering.
    - 5-minute epoxy
    - Small and sharp wire cutters
    - Fine forceps (e.g. Dumont #5) for stripping the cable
    - Soldering iron with a fine tip (0.2 mm diameter or smaller) and accurate temperature control
    - Fine solder (0.5 mm or thinner diameter)
    - No clean flux paste (e.g MG chemicals 8341)
    - A microscope is *highly* recommended for soldering and manipulation
      of stripped cable segments.

Cable Components
    - Coaxial cable segment (these instructions uses Axon Cable PCX40K10AK)
    - Hirose `X.FL-PR-SMT1-2(80) <https://www.hirose.com/product/p/CL0331-0713-7-80>`__ X.FL coaxial socket
    - 2 mm segment of 1.5 mm OD, 0.5 mm ID silicone tubing for strain relief. The
      easiest and cheapest way to get this is by striping the silicon jacket
      from a 24 AWG flexible hookup wire.

#. Press X.FL sockets onto the X.FL connectors on the solder jig. We've found
   that this is the most convenient method for holding these tiny pieces in
   place during soldering and gluing.

#. Set the soldering iron to ~260 C. Using a fine soldering iron tip
   (~0.2 mm or smaller), melt the plastic on the back side of the X.FL sockets
   to cover the holes in the plastic. This is required to prevent epoxy
   applied in later steps from getting into the mating surfaces of the
   connectors.

        :alt: X.FL with back holes melted closed.
        :align: center
        :width: 50%

#. Return the iron to soldering temperature (~370 C). Apply a dab of flux the
   contacts on the X.FL socket. Tin the two outer ground contacts on the socket
   along with the center pin connector.

#. Slide the 2 mm silicone tube over the end of the cable segment and push away
   from the tip for later use.

        :alt: 2mm silicon tube over coaxial cable.
        :align: center
        :width: 50%

#. Use the forceps to strip about 4-5 mm of the outer jacket from one end of
   the coaxial cable segment. This can be done by pinching the tip of the cable
   with the forceps and pulling it. This step may require some practice to get
   right.

        :width: 50%

   .. note:: If you are not able to cleanly remove the outer insulation from
        the coaxial cable on the first try, just cut the tip off and start
        over. Clean insulaiton removal makes everything easier.

#. Split the outer conductors into two bundles that pushed to either side of
   the cable. Use the forceps to strip the inner conductor in the same way as
   before. Tin the two outer-conductor bundles and the inner conductor.

        :alt: Stripped coax.
        :align: center
        :width: 100%

   .. important:: Ensure that there are no stray wires after this process as
        they can can cause shorts when the cable is soldered to the socket.

#. Solder the cable to the X.FL socket. Ensure that the outer connectors are
   not making contact with the inner conductor, e.g. by being placed directly
   over the center of the X.FL socket.

   .. image:: /_static/images/tether/hs-end_7.jpg

#. Trim the lead excess using the small wire cutters.

        :alt: Coax soldered to the X.FL socket with leads trimmed.
        :align: center
        :width: 50%

#. Mix and apply 5-minute epoxy to over the back of the X.FL socket. The epoxy
   should completely cover the solder joint and extend ~1 mm onto the cable
   itself.

   .. image:: /_static/images/tether/hs-end_9.jpg
        :alt: Coax soldered to the X.FL socket epoxy applied.
        :align: center
        :width: 50%

#. Before the epoxy begins to cure, slide the 2 mm silicone tubing sement into
   the epoxy, rotating a bit to ensure the inner portion and outer edge of the
   silicone tube get a layer of epoxy.

   .. image:: /_static/images/tether/hs-end_10.jpg
        :alt: Coax soldered to the X.FL socket epoxy applied.
        :align: center
        :width: 50%

#. Allow the epoxy to cure and then remove the completed assembly from the jig.

.. warning:: If expoxy has leaked between the X.FL contacts and bonded them
    together, then the socket's back was not properly melted in step 2, and
    cable probably will not work.

.. tip:: Typically, the jig will have multiple X.FL connectors so that several tethers to be made in parallel.

#. Mix and apply 5-minute epoxy to the well provided by the coax adapter to
   completely cover the solder joint. Put enough expoxy in the well such that
   it rises well above the edge and his held in place due to surface tension.
