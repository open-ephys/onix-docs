The RHS2116 Headstage is a serialized headstage for small animals with 32
bi-direcional channels which each can be used to deliver electrical stimuli.
The RHS2116 Headstage can be used with passive probes (e.g. silicon arrays, EEG/ECOG
arrays, etc) using a 36-Channel Omnetics EIB. 

********

For details on data serialization and headstage gateware, have a look at the
:ref:`serialization` page, which describes how coax headstages operate in
general terms. The RHS2116 headstage has the following coaxial link properties:

.. warning:: \*Do not exceed 5.0 VDC at the coaxial input to the headstage.
   Make sure you make this measurement at the headstage (see
   :ref:`measure_voltage`) to account for a potential voltage drop in the
   tether. 

.. note:: Have a look at the :ref:`tethers` page for more details on micro-coax
   headstage tethers

*****************
Electrophysiology
*****************

RHS2116 headstage uses two 16-channel `Intan RHS2116
<https://intantech.com/>`__ bioamplifier chip. The chip is operated at a fixed
sampling rate of ~30 kHz/channel. These 32 ephys channels are exposed via a 36
pin `Omnetics connector
<https://www.omnetics.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/A79025-001.pdf>`__ at the
edge of the headstage and can record from most passive probes (e.g. tetrodes,
silicon probe arrays, tungsten microwires, steel EEG wires, etc.) as well as
stimulate.
