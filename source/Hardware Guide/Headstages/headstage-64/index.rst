Headstage-64
##############################
**Headstage-64** is a serialized, multifunction headstage for small
animals. This headstage is designed to function with :ref:`eib_64` for `tetrode
microdrives <https://open-ephys.org/shuttledrive>`_. Alternatively it can be
used with other passive probes (e.g. silicon arrays, EEG/ECOG arrays, etc)
using :ref:`omnetics_adapter_64` or similar.

Data Link Serialization
**********************************
For details on data serialization and headstage gateware, have a look at the
:ref:`serialization` page, which describes how coax headstages operate in
general terms. Headstage-64 has the following coaxial link properties:

.. warning:: \*Do not exceed 6.3 VDC at the coaxial input to the headstage. Make
    sure you make this measurement at the headstage (see :ref:`measure_voltage`) to
    account for a potential voltage drop in the tether. Exceeding this voltage can
    permanently damage the headstage.

    headstage tethers

Electrophysiology & Auxiliary Analog Inputs
********************************************************
headstage-64 uses a 64-channel, BGA-packaged `Intan RHD2164
<https://intantech.com/>`_ bioamplifier chip. The chip is operated at a fixed
sampling rate of 30 kHz/channel (including auxiliary channels). Specifically,
it provides:

-   64 ephys channels exposed via a mezzanine connector on the bottom
    of the headstage and can be used to record from most passive probes (e.g.
    tetrodes, silicon probe arrays, tungsten microwires, steel EEG wires, etc.) 

-   3 auxiliary channels:

    -   2x auxiliary channels (0.1-2.45V input range) are pinned out on the bottom of
        the headstage to an unpopulated mezzanine connector and solder-able test
        points

    -   A 3rd auxiliary analog channel is tied to the electrical stimulator's current
        measurement circuit via a selectable solder jumper on the bottom of the
        board. This jumper can be desoldered and instead a series resistor added to
        allow low-frequency LFP recordings as per pg. 26 of the RHD2000 datasheet.

..  attention:: The headstage connector pinout (ADC input mapping, stimulation connections, etc) is located on `this Google sheet <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11wRDYOqHN5lPb03yUdfXfK0zvaDYsVetplaNK-R90Gg/edit#gid=663991061>`__.

3D Position Tracking
**********************
.. todo::  Move this into its own page

headstage-64 has four `SteamVR <https://store.steampowered.com/steamvr>`_
receivers for 3D position tracking.

.. warning:: These receivers are compatible with both V1 and V2 ("index" branded)
    basestations. Although the firmware we supply for the headstage can be used
    to obtain 3D position from kinds of basestation, we consider V1
    basestations deprecated and cannot guarantee future functionality.

Assuming you are using `V2
basestations <https://store.steampowered.com/app/1059570/Valve_Index_Base_Station/>`_,
to set up tracking,

#. Mount each of the basestations so that they have a clear line of sight to as
   much of the behavioral space as possible. For a relatively flat arena, the
   simplest configuration is to mount two basestations directly above the
   behavioral space inline and separated by 0.5 to 1 meters. For more complex
   environments more than 2 basestations are required to get full coverage, any
   configuration is possible so long 2 basestations have a line of site to the
   headstage and are no more than 4 meters away. For this, there are lots of
   options for ready-made, adjustable basestation mounts available on Amazon and
   elsewhere.
#. Serial into each of the basestations using the USB connection on the back
   and set up a terminal connection using ``screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200`` or
   similar
#. Once connected you can hit Tab to see commands
#. Set the mode of of each base station to a different value using
   ``mode n`` where ``n`` is the desired mode (1-16). The only requirement is
   that each basestation have a unique mode.

.. note:: If a basestation loses power, it will reset to mode 1. Its best to
    just leave the basestations plugged in and untouched to minimize the need to
    for re-calibration and mode programming

#. TODO: obtain the position and orientation of each basestations

3D Orientation Tracking
*************************
headstage-64 has a `BNO055
<https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/products/smart-sensors/bno055/>`_ 9-axis
inertial measurement unit that provides the absolute orientation of the
headstage. This device produces orientation (and other) measurements are 100
Hz.

Neural Stimulation
****************************
headstage-64 provides onboard electrical and optical stimulus generators.
Stimulus trains can be parameterized in a similar way to the master-8 or pulse
pal.

.. note:: To achieve the shortest latency, electrical or optical stimulation can be triggered
    using the GPIO1 serializer output. Because both stimulators share this trigger line,
    it is important to only enable one of the devices (using its ENABLE register) prior
    to toggling this pin.

Optical Stimulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Optical stimulation is provided by a dual-channel, high-current LED driver.
This driver can be used for LEDs or laser diodes. It provides 800-mA per
channel. The cathodic connections can be paralleled to increase max current.
The maximum peak current in 1.6 Amps. However, if you deliver this current for
a significant amount of time, the headstage will shutdown due to an
over-temperature condition. The optical stimulator is only appropriate for low
duty-cycle pulse-type stimulation.

Electical Stimulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The electrical stimulation circuit is an improved Howland current pump followed by
an precision current measurement circuit. The current pump is supplied by +/-15V
rails and can supply up to +/- 2.5 mA. The output current is defined as:

.. warning:: The headstage must be supplied by 5.5V, :ref:`measured at the DC couping 
   inductor <measure_voltage>`, to use electrical stimulation. If the voltage is less 
   than this, stimulus pulses will fail to achieve target currents and this will result 
   in charge imbalance, which can damage neural tissue.

.. code-block:: none

    ISTIM = (VDAC  - 2.5)/1000.
    e.g.
    VDAC = 2.5   -> ISTIM = 0
    VDAC = 5.0   -> ISTIM = 2.5 mA
    VDAC = 0.0   -> ISTIM = -2.5mA

.. code-block:: none

    Imeas = 400 * ISTIM + 1.25V
    e.g.
    ISTIM = 0      -> IMEAS = 1.25V
    ISTIM = 2.5mA  -> IMEAS = 2.25V
    ISTIM = -2.5mA -> IMEAS = 0.25V
