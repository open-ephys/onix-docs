PCIe Bracket Assembly
########################################

The :ref:`pcie_host` host has a 3D printed front panel/bracket. This exposes
the PCIe Host IO and allows the device to be mounted in a standard PCIe slot.

#. Coat the inside of the light-pipe holes and LED sockets with a very small
   amount of 5 minute epoxy. Insert the light pipes from the front until flush
   with the face of the bracket. Insert the LEDs from the back (the holes are
   keyed).

#. Cut the ribbon cable in to two 8 cm segments. Strip the wires on one of
   them. Slip heat shrink segments over each of the 8 wires.

#. Solder the wires to the LED leads in the orientation shown below. Note the
   plug orientation. Slip the tube segments over the solder joint and shrink
   with heat gun.
