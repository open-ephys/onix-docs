########################################

Insert the PCIe Host Module
---------------------------------------
#. Power off the computer.

#. Plug the PCIe host board into an available PCIe slot

   .. important:: Although the board will power on without it, 
        you must plug a single PCIe power output from the 
        computer's ATX power supply into the board to ensure 
        stable operation.

#. Boot the computer.

#. The RGB LED in the center of the module should be blue.

   .. note:: The RGB LED has three color states.

        - Blue: Ready to go.
        - Yellow: Acquisition stopped.
        - Pink: Acquisition running.

Disable Secure Boot
---------------------------------------

#. Navigate to your BIOS

#. Turn off Secure Boot (Under 'Boot' change OS type to 'Other OS')

Put Windows In Testing Mode
---------------------------------------

.. note:: As of this writing, the ONIX driver is not digitally signed by
    Microsoft, but in a developer testing phase. Following the conclusion of the
    beta-test period, we will complete this process and the following steps
    will not be required.


#. Download the :download:`OpenEphysTestDriver.cer
   <../../_static/downloads/onix-driver-releases/riffa/OpenEphysTestDriver.cer>`
   testing certificate and double click it.

#. On the resulting dialog, select **Install Certificate**.

   .. figure:: /_static/images/pcie-host-windows/install-certificate.png
        :align: center

#. It is recommended to select **Current User** certificate storage option.

   .. figure:: /_static/images/pcie-host-windows/certificate-import-current-user.png
        :align: center

#. For ease of management, it is recommended to manually select a certificate
   storage and chose **Personal**.

   .. figure:: /_static/images/pcie-host-windows/certificate-import-personal-storage.png
        :align: center

#. Open the Windows Start Menu and type **cmd** to find the command prompt
   application. Right click it and chose **Run as Administrator**.

   .. figure:: /_static/images/pcie-host-windows/cmd-run-as-admin.png
        :align: center

#. Execute the following command: ``bcdedit /set testsigning on``

   .. figure:: /_static/images/pcie-host-windows/windows-test-mode-command.png
        :align: center

#. Restart the computer.

   .. note:: A regular reboot ('restart') is required. A complete power cycle
        (turning the PC off completely) may not set the option.

#. You should see now some text at the bottom right of the Desktop indicating
   that Windows is operating in testing mode:

   .. figure:: /_static/images/pcie-host-windows/windows-test-mode-text.png
        :align: center

   .. note:: The computer will keep the test state until you run ``bcdedit /set
        testsigning off`` in an administrator command prompt again and reboot the
        computer

Install C++ Runtime
---------------------------------------
Windows does not ship with a C++ runtime. Before using ONIX on windows, you
will need to install `Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio
2015, 2017 and 2019 <https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe>`__.

Install Device Driver
---------------------------------------

.. warning:: Pre-built drivers target 64-bit Windows 10. Other targets will
    need to be compiled from source.

#. Download the :ref:`latest riffa driver <riffa_driver_download>` and unzip
   the archive.
#. In the extracted folder, right click the **riffa.inf** file.  Select
   **install** from the context menu.
#. Open the start menu and type **device manager** and click to open. You shoul
   see **RIFFA** in the device tree.
