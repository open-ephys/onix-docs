EIB-64L
#########################
**EIB-64L** is a 64-channel electrode interface board (EIB) with
electrical and optical stimulation. Designed for large animal (e.g. rat)
tetrode electrophysiology and is compatible with :ref:`headstage_64` and is
designed to be used with the rat variant of the `shuttle-drive
<https://open-ephys.org/shuttledrive>`_.

Tetrode Connectorization
****************************
This EIB uses `Neuralynx "large" gold pins
<https://neuralynx.fh-co.com/research-hardware/animal-interfaces/microdrive-preparation/large-eib-pins/>`_ 
to attach tetrode wires.
Usage instructions are provided in the `Neuralynx EIB pin Manual
<https://neuralynx.com/documents/EIB%20Pins%20Manual.pdf>`_.
