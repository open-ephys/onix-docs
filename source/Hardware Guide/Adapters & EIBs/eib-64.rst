EIB-64
############################
**EIB-64** is a 64-channel electrode interface board (EIB) that supports
integrated electrical and optical stimulation. It is designed for small animal
(e.g. mouse) tetrode electrophysiology and is compatible with
:ref:`headstage_64` and is designed to be used with the mouse variant of the
`shuttle-drive <https://open-ephys.org/shuttledrive>`_.
