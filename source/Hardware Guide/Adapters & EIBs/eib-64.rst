EIB-64
############################
**EIB-64** is a 64-channel electrode interface board (EIB) that supports
integrated electrical and optical stimulation. It is designed for small animal
(e.g. mouse) tetrode electrophysiology and is compatible with
:ref:`headstage_64` and is designed to be used with the mouse variant of the
`shuttle-drive <https://open-ephys.org/shuttledrive>`_.

Tetrode Connectorization
****************************
This EIB uses `Neuralynx "small" gold pins
<https://neuralynx.fh-co.com/research-hardware/animal-interfaces/microdrive-preparation/small-eib-pins/>`_ 
to attach tetrode wires.
Usage instructions are provided in the `Neuralynx EIB pin Manual
<https://neuralynx.com/documents/EIB%20Pins%20Manual.pdf>`_.
